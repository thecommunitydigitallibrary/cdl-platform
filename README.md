# TextData
TextData is an online and open-source platform that helps you save what you know and find what you don't. We offer a stand-alone website and a Chrome extension, all for free.


To use TextData, you have three options:

1. Full online version: Visit [textdata.org](https://textdata.org/), install the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-community-digital-lib/didjjbenidcdopncjajdoeniaplicdee?hl=en&authuser=0), create an account, and begin using TextData.
2. Full offline version: Clone this repository, set up Docker, and run the services locally. This is described in the section below titled "Setting Up the Local Version".
3. Hosted backend, local frontend: You can leverage the APIs for the backend, and create or extend your own frontend (website or browser extension). The API documentation is [here](https://github.com/thecommunitydigitallibrary/cdl-platform/tree/dev/backend).

<summary>Setting Up the Offline Version</summary>
<br>

## Setting Up the Offline Version
Note that the local version is still under development:

- No data is persisted; once the Docker containers stops, all data is lost.
- "Reset Password" will not work due to no access to SendGrid.

### Requirements for running locally
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for Windows
- [Configuring Docker for OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/docker/). If you are running on Windows (and thus using WSL for Docker), then follow [these directions](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5202) for increasing vm.max_map_count.
```
open powershell
wsl -d docker-desktop
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```
- With all of the Docker containers, packages, and models, the total size is ~10GB. Without Neural, it is ~3GB.

### Configuring the env files
Copy the following to ``backend\env_local.ini``:

```
api_url=http://localhost
api_port=8080
webpage_port=8080
jwt_secret=0047fa567bbddf121b23d1deaa7ff2af
redis_host=redis
redis_port=6379
redis_password=admin
cdl_uri=mongodb://mongodb:27017/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
cdl_test_uri=mongodb://localhost:27017
db_name=cdl-local
elastic_username=admin
elastic_password=admin
elastic_index_name=submissions
elastic_webpages_index_name=webpages
elastic_domain=http://host.docker.internal:9200/
elastic_domain_backfill=http://localhost:9200/
```

Copy the following to ``frontend\website\.env.local``":
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FROM_SERVER=http://host.docker.internal:8080/
NEXT_PUBLIC_FROM_CLIENT=http://localhost:8080/
```
Copy the following to ``frontend\extension\.env.local`` ":
```
REACT_APP_URL=http://localhost:8080/
REACT_APP_WEBSITE=http://localhost:8080/
```

### Starting the services

#### Website, backend API, MongoDB, and OpenSearch:

Add the following to ``docker-compose.yml``:

```
services:
    redis:
        image: redis:alpine
        command: redis-server --requirepass admin
        restart: always
        ports:
            - '6379:6379'

    reverseproxy:
        image: reverseproxy
        build:
            context: ./reverseproxy
            dockerfile: Dockerfile-local
        ports:
            - 8080:8080
        restart: always

    mongodb:
        image: mongo
        ports:
            - 27017:27017
        restart: always
        command: mongod --bind_ip 0.0.0.0

    opensearch-node1:
        image: opensearchproject/opensearch:latest
        container_name: opensearch-node1
        environment:
            - cluster.name=opensearch-cluster
            - node.name=opensearch-node1
            - discovery.seed_hosts=opensearch-node1
            - cluster.initial_cluster_manager_nodes=opensearch-node1
            - bootstrap.memory_lock=true
            - DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN=true
            - "OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
        ulimits:
            memlock:
                soft: -1
                hard: -1
            nofile:
                soft: 65536 # Maximum number of open files for the opensearch user - set to at least 65536
                hard: 65536
        ports:
        - 9200:9200 # REST API

    website:
        depends_on:
            - reverseproxy
        image: website
        build: ./frontend/website
        env_file: ./frontend/website/.env.local
        restart: always
        extra_hosts:
            - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"

    api:
        depends_on:
            - reverseproxy
            - redis
            - mongodb
            - opensearch-node1
        image: api
        build: ./backend
        restart: always
        env_file: ./backend/env_local.ini

```

Run the docker-compose file: ``docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build``

To stop: ``docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down``


If you would like to add the neural options (reranking, generation), add the following to ``backend\env_local.ini`` and restart docker-compose:

```
neural_api=http://host.docker.internal:9300/
```

Note that the slashes need to be reversed if running on Mac/Linux (above is written for windows).

Then, navigate to the neural folder, add the following to ``env_neural_prod.ini``

```
hf_token=<your huggingface token>
```

Finally, to start the neural docker container (requires GPU), run the following from the ``neural`` folder: 

```
docker build -t .
docker run --gpus --env-file env_neural_prod.ini -p 9300:80 hash_of_above_image
```

#### Extension:
Navigate to ``frontend\extension`` and run ``npm ci`` and then run ``npm run build``. Then upload the ``build`` file to Chrome while using Development Mode. Once uploaded, open the extention, go to the setting section and chnage the backend source from textdata.org to other and click on Save. 


### Running Test cases
Note: Local Docker containers must be up and running before you run below commands
```
cd <project-directory>\backend
pytest .\tests\test_server.py
```

### Running the Back-Fill script
Note: Local Docker containers must be up and running before you run below commands
```
cd <project-directory>\backend
python .\app\helpers\backfill.py [--env_path] [--type=<"submissions" or "webpages">]
```
Here, `--env_path` is an optional argument that takes the path to the environment file, and the default file considered is `backend\env_local.ini`.

The `--type` is another optional argument that takes two values: `submissions` or `webpages`, and the default value is `submissions`.

## Building on Top of the Hosted Backend
See the API documentation [here](https://github.com/thecommunitydigitallibrary/cdl-platform/tree/dev/backend). Please be courteous regarding the amount of API calls so that the backend servers do not get overwhelmed.
