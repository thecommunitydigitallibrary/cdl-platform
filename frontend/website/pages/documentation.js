                            The CDL project began in the fall of 2022, and its original purpose was to support an information retrieval and ranking course assignment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The original development was done by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kevinros.github.io/">Kevin Ros</a>, the TA at the time, who created a basic version of the CDL to be used in the course. As the semester progressed, Kevin and his PhD advisor/course instructor, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/">Dr. ChengXiang Zhai</a>, realized that the CDL could be generalized to a much more powerful online platform that could support numerous features, act as a sandbox for researching retrieval and recommendation, and allow the collection of various data sets to study user interactions. Since the fall of 2022, Kevin had led a team of developers, from the University of Illinois, under the supervision of Dr. Zhai, to build the CDL into what you see here today. And the CDL has become a central component in Kevin's PhD thesis.

                            Much like a group chat, a subreddit, or a folder, a community is a way for you and your peers to logically organize content on the CDL. You can create, join, or leave communities, and any member of a community can search for or browse all content present in the community. A community can have any number of members, ranging from just yourself (e.g., a private community to save your personal bookmarks) to hundreds of members (e.g., a large classroom).

                            You can create a community by selecting the "Communities" tab in the navigation header bar at the top of the CDL website, and then clicking the "+" in the "Create" box. You will need to provide a name, which should describe the purpose of the community (e.g., "Papers", "CS410 Fall 2023", or "Cool News Articles"). After creating a community, your page should refresh and you should see the newly-created community's card on your screen. If you would like to change the name or add a description, you can click the pen "edit" button on the card and edit the desired details.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To join a community, you can click the join card's arrow and paste the respective community's join key. Then after clicking "join", your communities page should refresh and you should see your newly-joined community's card.

                        <p>
                            To leave a community, you can click the exit button on a community's card. In the case that you'd like to rejoin the community, you can either re-enter the join key or navigate to the "History" tab on the Communities page and select the respective community's rejoin button.

                            A submission is the fundamental building block of the CDL. Submissions are user-created, and consist of a URL, a title, and a description. Submissions can be added to or removed from communities, and if you are are a member of a community, then you can search over, browse, and view all submissions currently added to a community. The title and description of a submission are meant to provide you with a way to explain how the webpage is helpful for you or the other members of the community.

                            You can create a submission by using either Chrome extension's "Submit" tab or by clicking the "+" on the CDL website header. A submission consists of the current URL (i.e., the page that you opened the extension on), a title, and a description. With the extension, you do not need to manually enter a URL because the extension automatically captures it from the browser API. After selecting a community and clicking "Submit," all of this will be saved as a submission to the selected community.

                            The submission card provides you with numerous ways to view and interact with the submission. Clicking the hyperlinked title at the top of the submission card will open the submitted URL in another tab. Below the hyperlinked title is the shortened submitted URL and submission time. Below this is the submission's description. And at the bottom left of the submission are the names of the communities that the submission is a part of, and the list of hashtags (if any). Hashtags are automatically extracted from the title and description, and are meant to provide you with a way to easily search for and filter submissions. More information about hashtags can be found in the Search section below. Following searches or recommendations, each submission card will contain relevance judgment buttons at the bottom left. These buttons are meant to provide you with a way to rate the submissions with respect to your query or recommendation context.

                        <p>
                            Each submission card also contains three dots at the top right corner. Clicking these three dots will open a small menu with multiple options. Clicking the first option, "View Submission", will bring you to the CDL's submission page. On this page, you will be able to view the submission's full title and description, see the submissions views/clicks/shares, add or remove the submission from a community, and edit or delete the submission (if you are the submission's creator). Clicking the "Feedback" button will open a small pop-up window where you can send feedback about the submission to the CDL (e.g., if the submission is inappropriate or the link is broken). And clicking the "Share URL" will copy the URL of the page to your clipboard. This "Feedback" and "Share URL" functionality is also available as the second and third option in the three dot menu. The submission page also displays a basic visualization of the submission with respect to other submissions made to your communities.

                            Searching within the Community Digital Library is a straightforward process. Whether you are looking for specific content or exploring new resources, our search functionality can assist you in finding what you need. You are able to search over all submissions that have been added to your communities, and you can perform searches using either the CDL website or the Chrome extension.
                        </p>

                            To search submissions via the CDL website, you can leverage the search bar in the website header. In this search bar, you can enter keyword-based queries (e.g., "bm25") or natural language questions (e.g., "what is the intuition behind bm25?"). Moreover, you can add hashtags to your query (e.g., "bm25 #Lecture1") to restrict your results to those that match the hashtag. And you can filter searches by community using the dropdown menu to the right of the search bar. By default, the search occurs over all of your joined communities. Following the search, you should see a ranked list of submissions corresponding to your query. You also have the ability to judge the relevance of each result via the submission judgment buttons, thus helping us improve the ranking formula.

                            You can perform searches via the Chrome extension underneath the Chrome extension's "Search" tab. The extension supports the exact same search functionality as the CDL website described above. However, opening the "Search" tab will automatically present recommendations according to your current context (e.g., your current webpage and highlighted text, if any). More information about this feature is presented in the Recommendations section below.

                            The Community Digital Library provides various ways to help you discover submissions made to your communities. The overarching goal of recommendations on the CDL is to provide you with submissions according to your context: your current webpage, previously-clicked submissions, previously-submitted webpages, other members of your community, etc.

                            The homepage of the CDL, accessible by clicking the CDL logo at the top left of the webpage header, provides you with two methods of general recommendations: "Explore" and "Most Recent". You can select one or the other via the dropdown menu towards the top of the homepage. The "Explore" method recommends submissions most similar to your most recent submissions. And the "Most Recent" method displays all submissions made to all of your communities in reverse chronological order.

                            The Chrome extension provides contextual recommendations to you when you open the "Search" tab of the extension. Here, the extension pulls the current webpage's URL, webpage title, and webpage description and uses this to find submissions related to the webpage. The submissions will automatically appear beneath the search bar.

                        <p>
                            Certain communities often have what we call core content - content that members of a community tend to visit very frequently. For example, a community that was created for a university course could consider all of the lecture videos as core content. The CDL provides various features to help community members organize and discover submissions around this core content. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any member of a community can make a core submission to a community, which indicates that the submitted webpage is a part of that community's core content. To do so, you should include the hashtag "#core" in either the title or the description of the submission.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Including this "#core" hashtag allows all members of a community to explicitly connect submissions to the core content. For example, suppose the core submission included the hashtags "#core #lecture1", indicating that the submission linked to the first lecture of an online course. Then, any future submission to the community that includes "#lecture1" will be connected to the core submission containing "lecture1". These connections can be seen on the core submission's webpage - when the extension is opened, the automatic recommendations will first present the linked submissions (if any).
                        </p>
                    </>

                            In some search or recommendation results, you may notice submissions that are from a community called "Webpage". These submissions are webpages that have been automatically scraped by the CDL. The title and description of the submission are the title and description of the webpage, respectively. The CDL attempts to scrape and index all submitted webpages that are publicly available, so that all members of the CDL can benefit from a submission.

                            If you would prefer to use the CDL locally (e.g., run the server and databases on your computer), then you can follow the directions listed on  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/thecommunitydigitallibrary/cdl-platform">GitHub</a>. The extension is also locally compatible by changing the Backend Source under the settings icon tab.

                            One of the primary use cases of the CDL is personal bookmarking and archiving. This is best supported by creating a community (or communities) according to the type of content that you would like to save. For example, a community where you save interesting news articles could be called "News Articles", or a community where you save academic publications could be called "Papers and Demos". And, as you submit webpages to your personal community, you can add hashtags according to whatever taxonomy you would like to have (e.g., "#empirical" or "#politics"). And after creating the community, you will be its only member, meaning that all bookmarks saved by you are accessible and viewable by only you.                      
                        </p>
                    </>

                        <p>
                            The CDL can also be used for adding and organizing online content relating to course lectures. One pain point of courses prevalent today, especially in online courses, is that students often seek course-related online information independently. For example, while watching a lecture, a student may have a question about something mentioned in the lecture. Then, the student may turn to an online search engine to find webpages helpful for resolving their information need. This is done independently of other students or the instructor. As a result, neither other students nor the instructor can benefit from the student's work of finding helpful course-related information. The CDL aims to mitigate this problem by providing a way to organize online content with respect to the course content and a way to search and discover the online content when in specific course-related contexts. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instructors who wish to leverage this functionality in their course should first create a course community named accordingly (e.g., "Spring 2023 CS101"). Then, to optionally leverage the core community content feature, they can add each lecture webpage to define a coupling between webpage URL and hashtag. Each submission for the core community content should contain at least two hashtags: "#core" and the hashtag(s) that define this web resource (e.g., "#lecture1", "quiz1", etc.). Once the community is created and the core content is added, the instructor should have each student create a CDL account and send the community join key to all of the students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once the students are in the community and begin to consume the core community content (i.e., the course content), they can begin making submissions. For example, suppose a student watches the first lecture ("#lecture1"), and finds that they needed to seek out an additional web resource to understand the concepts mentioned in the lecture. They can then create a submission of that web resource to the course community with the hashtag "#lecture1", and a title/description explaining why the webpage is helpful. Then, the next time that a student opens the Chrome extension on the first lecture's web page, the extension should provide the student's submission as a recommendation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over time, as the community content grows, it can be difficult to understand the breadth of the submitted content. The CDL provides a simple visualization of all community submissions with respect to the hashtags. To see this, you can navigate to the Communities tab in the header of the CDL website, and for any community's card, you can click the Visualization icon. This will bring you to a top-down view of the community's submitted content with respect to the hashtags, organized by topics.
