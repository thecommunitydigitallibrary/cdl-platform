        The Chrome extension can be downloaded from <a target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-community-digital-lib/didjjbenidcdopncjajdoeniaplicdee?hl=en&authuser=0">the Chrome Web Store</a>. After installing, don't forget to pin the newly-added extension to your browser.
        After opening the extension, you should see a login screen. Please log
        in to the extension with the same credentials that you used for the
        website account you created in Step 1.
      </p>

        Installation of the Chrome extension is optional - TextData works best with it installed, but you can still use the basic functionality of the platform without the Chrome extension.

        Much like a group chat, a subreddit, or a folder, a community is place for you and your peers to save and organize notes. 
        You can create, join, or leave communities, and any member of a community can search for or browse all content present in the community.
        Click <a target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/communities">here</a> to join or create a community.

      <div>
      <p style={{ margin: "10px 0px 0px 0px" }}>
        You can think of a submission like a bookmark or note page. Submissions are saved to a particular community and are accessible by any member of the community. Each submission consists of a title, an optional source URL, and a markdown-based description. You can create a submission by clicking the "+" button in the header or by the Chrome extension's "Save" tab.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you create your first submission, you can refresh this page to view the full TextData homepage. But don't worry, you can still revisit these setup instructions by clicking "Setup Instruction" in the footer. Enjoy TextData!
